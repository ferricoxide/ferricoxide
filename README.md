Looks like GitHub's letting you get fancy-schmancy with your profile, now. I'ma put something basic here, for now ...but I'm gonna do so in a way that evokes late-90s/early-2000s vanity pages. No, I'm not gonna toss &lt;BLINK&gt; tags in. No, I'm not gonna go completely GeoCities ...but I _am_ gonna throw an "Under Construction" image out there. Maybe someday, I'll take the time to make it look like a slow-to-load progressive JPEG.
